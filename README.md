### Community Energy Projects
Community-owned renewable generation assets (solar farms, wind turbines) can distribute benefits directly to community members through automated trading and dividend distribution.

### Commercial Microgrid Operation
Business parks or industrial zones can create localized energy markets, trading energy between buildings to optimize costs and resilience while providing grid services.

### Rural Electrification
Off-grid or weak-grid communities can develop local energy markets that optimize the use of limited generation resources and encourage investment in new capacity.
